# low-level engine core
Low-Level Engine Core (or LLEC), is a c++ framework designed to assist developers in the realms of game development and various other fields. Developed using c++20, this engine framework offers a versatile set of tools and specialized data structures.

Built with efficiency in mind, LLEC serves as a foundation for creating game/simulaton engines. LLEC is lightweight, cross-platform and has no external dependencies apart from the c++ standard library which makes it suitable for small-scale engines, prototypes or applications.
